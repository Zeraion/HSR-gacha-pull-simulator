#This is a simulator for the Gacha game Honkai Star Rail. Run the program and enter the number of Stellar Jades (in game currency) and number of times you wish to run the simulator. It will return the average number of 5 star characters pulled over the number of sims run.
#The more times you run the simulator, the closer your numbers will be to the 'statistically expected' result.
#But if you just want to simulate one round of gacha, then set the number of times to run as 1.
